# Car controller for games using OpenCV

# Info
- Use OpenCV to detect contours and filters out the blue color on the steering wheel (See [Sample steering wheel in pic]
- It then gets the slope of the line formed using the center of the wheel and the top of the wheel and uses that to determine the steering input
- Also, the position center of the wheel is responsible for braking and accelerating
